# Intro_ai
This is a repo that contains weekly assignment for the course "Intro to AI".
I'll be using jupyter notbook to solve the task.
I'm using this repository for storing my solutions, and be able to go back and modify them, as I learn more. 

# Lab 1 - Data
The intention behind this lab is that i will get familiar with the process of reading a dataset and
exploring a little through the pandas framework.

# Lab 2 - Data
Second data oriented lab with more data vleaning and feature engineering. 
For this lab we got a Picture of a table made out of the titanic.csv file. Our task was to re-create this table with featuring engineering.

# Lab 3 - NLP Topic Modeling (part1)
NPL time. Throughout this lab I'll get a light intro to using modern ML libraries to do beginner level topic modeling on youtube titles, with data from a kraggle data-set. This lab I'll be provided with some code that we have not learn yet, but this is to get an introduction and some general understanding of how ML modeling works
 This lab was also part of our first obligatory assigment in this course. 
The objective of the assigment was to show understanding of the code, by documenting each code block with preceding markdown blocks where I explained what the code is doing. 

# Lab 4 - 
In this lab we're using xgdboost for regression based on predictions. This lab was also part of our first obligatory assigment in this course. 
The objective of the assigment was to show understanding of the code, by documenting each code block with preceding markdown blocks where I explained what the code is doing. 

# Lab 5 - 
In this lab I'll use XGBoost ot predict whether a galaxy is a star, a galaxy or a quasar. I'll be using a subset of the [SSD dr14](https://www.sdss.org/dr14/) which is found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lucidlenn/sloan-digital-sky-survey).
This typev of ML is called a multi-class-classification and is **supervised machine learning**. I'll be using the XGBoost library to train a model to predict the class of a galaxy based on its features.
