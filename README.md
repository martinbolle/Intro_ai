# Intro_ai

This is a repo that contains weekly assignment for the course "Intro to AI".
I'll be using jupyter notbook to solve the task.

# Lab 1 - Data
The intention behind this lab is that i will get familiar with the process of reading a dataset and
exploring a little through the pandas framework.

# Lab 2 - Data
Second data oriented lab with more data vleaning and feature engineering.
